## Project Overview
The Image-to-Word/PDF Converter is designed to help university students easily convert their handwritten or printed notes into editable and searchable digital formats. By using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology, this application allows users to upload images and convert them into Word or PDF documents, making study materials more accessible and manageable.

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Drag-and-drop or select images to upload.
- **OCR Processing**: Extracts text from printed and handwritten notes.
- **Convert to Word/PDF**: Create editable Word documents or PDFs.
- **File Management**: Access, manage, and download your converted files from a personal dashboard.
- **Feedback System**: Provide feedback on OCR and conversion quality to improve the service.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Python (Flask) or Node.js (Express)
- **OCR Engine**: Tesseract OCR or Google Cloud Vision API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- **Storage**: AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for file storage
- **Styling**: CSS, Bootstrap, or Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Jest, Mocha, PyTest for unit and integration testing

## Architecture
The system is built on a client-server architecture with a frontend for user interactions, a backend for processing requests, an OCR engine for text extraction, and a database for storing files and metadata.

- **Frontend**: Handles the user interface, file uploads, and interactions.
- **Backend**: Manages the business logic, OCR processing, and file conversions.
- **OCR Service**: Extracts text from uploaded images.
- **Database**: Stores file metadata, user information, and feedback.
- **File Storage**: Saves uploaded images and converted documents securely.

## Installation
